# 🜁 Obelisk — Secret Faction for D&D

**Obelisk** is a secretive, hierarchical organization designed for use in dark fantasy and intrigue-driven Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.

Operating from the shadows, the Obelisk seeks to overthrow the rule of the elven city and claim dominion over the Forest of Azure Leaves. With a rigid internal structure, masked operatives, and a resonance-powered golem, this faction is ideal for campaigns involving espionage, sabotage, and magical warfare.
